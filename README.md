React textarea component to automatically expand and contract your textareas.

You can [view the demo here](http://rpearce.github.io/react-expanding-textarea/).

## Installation
Install the package via NPM:
```
$ npm install --save react-expanding-textarea
```

## Usage
Use this exactly like you would a normal `<textarea>`; the only
difference is that it is doing some simple expanding work behind the scenes for you!
```js
import Textarea from 'react-expanding-textarea'

function handleChange(e) {
  console.log('Changed value to: ', e.target.value)
}

const myComponent = () =>
  <Textarea
    rows="1"
    maxLength="3000"
    maxHeight={100}
    className="textarea"
    name="post[notes]"
    placeholder="Notes"
    onChange={ handleChange } />
```
